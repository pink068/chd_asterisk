; Generate custom formats for formats requiring attributes.
; After defining the custom format, the name used in defining
; the format can be used throughout Asterisk in the format 'allow'
; and 'disallow' options.
;
; Example: silk8 is a predefined custom format in this config file.
; Once this config file is loaded, silk8 can be used anywhere a
; peer's codec capabilities are defined.
;
; In sip.conf 'silk8' can be defined as a capability for a peer.

;============================ OPUS Section Options ============================
;
;[opus]
;type= ; Must be of type "opus" (default: "")
;packet_loss= ; Encoder's packet loss percentage. Can be any number between 0
              ; and 100, inclusive. A higher value results in more loss
              ; resistance. (default: 0)
;complexity= ; Encoder's computational complexity. Can be any number between 0
             ; and 10, inclusive. Note, 10 equals the highest complexity.
             ; (default: 10)
;max_bandwidth= ; Encoder's maximum bandwidth allowed. Sets an upper bandwidth
                ; bound on the encoder. Can be any of the following: narrow,
                ; medium, wide, super_wide, full. (default: full)
;signal= ; Encoder's signal type. Aids in mode selection on the encoder: Can
         ; be any of the following: auto, voice, music. (default: auto)
;application= ; Encoder's application type. Can be any of the following: voip,
              ; audio, low_delay. (default: voip)
;max_playback_rate= ; Override the maximum playback rate in the offer's SDP.
                    ; Any value between 8000 and 48000 (inclusive) is valid,
                    ; however typically it should match one of the usual opus
                    ; bandwidths. A value of "sdp" is also allowed. When set
                    ; to "sdp" then the value from the offer's SDP is used.
                    ; (default: "sdp")
;bitrate= ; Override the maximum average bitrate in the offer's SDP. Any value
          ; between 500 and 512000 is valid. The following values are also
          ; allowed: auto, max, sdp. When set to "sdp" then the value from
          ; the offer's sdp is used. (default: "sdp")
;cbr= ; Override the constant bit rate parameter in the offer's SDP. A value of
      ; 0/false/no represents a variable bit rate whereas 1/true/yes represents
      ; a constant bit rate. A value of "sdp" is also allowed. When set to "sdp"
      ; then the value from the offer's sdp is used. (default: "sdp")
;fec= ; Override the use inband fec parameter in the offer's SDP. A value of
      ; 0/false/no represents disabled whereas 1/true/yes represents enabled.
      ; A value of "sdp" is also allowed. When set to "sdp" then the value from
      ; the offer's sdp is used. (default: "sdp")
;dtx= ; Override the use dtx parameter in the offer's SDP. A value of 0/false/no
      ; represents disabled whereas 1/true/yes represents enabled. A value of
      ; "sdp" is also allowed. When set to "sdp" then the value from the offer's
      ; sdp is used. (default: "sdp")
